    <h2>The building</h2>

    <div class="feature">
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>
        Eklavya Kulam embodies a commitment to sustainability and innovation. Designed according to Vastu principles, the open north and east sides maximize natural light and ventilation while minimizing direct sunlight, creating a comfortable, eco-conscious environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        The structure utilizes solar power for common areas and boasts a green, carbon-neutral design.  Built using prefabricated architecture—a more sustainable approach than traditional construction methods—the building showcases a raw aesthetic that highlights its engineering ingenuity. Open floor plans and minimalist interiors create a modern, inspiring workspace.
      </p>

    <div class="feature">
      <h3>Safety</h3>
      <p>
        At Eklavya Kulam, the safety and security of our tenants are paramount. Our building adheres to the latest fire and electrical safety regulations, ensuring a secure working environment. A sprinkler system, supported by a dedicated on-site water tank, is installed throughout the building for comprehensive fire protection. In the unlikely event of an emergency, two well-marked staircases provide ample evacuation routes.
        <br>
        <br>
        To ensure uninterrupted workflow, we've equipped the building with robust electrical backup systems, Eklavya Kulam operates as a closed campus, with 24/7 security personnel and surveillance. Access is restricted to badged personnel, and parking is available exclusively for registered tenants. Additionally, two public elevators are available, ensuring accessibility and minimizing disruption in the event of maintenance or malfunction.
